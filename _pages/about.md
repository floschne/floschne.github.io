Hi, I'm Flo!

I'm a passionate computer scientist whose IT journey began back in 2005 when I first got in touch with archaic MS-DOS. 16 years later, in the summer of 2021, I graduated as M.Sc. at the University of Hamburg and just started working as a research assistant in the university's Language Technology (LT) group under the direction of Prof. Dr. Chris Biemann.

During my studies, I found keen interest and amazement in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, which are now my active research fields. More specifically, my main interest lies in multimodal visio-linguistic methods and models to achieve a more natural and human-like grounding and understanding of natural language through visual information and vice versa.

While doing my M.Sc. I was working for LT group as a student researcher, among other things as a scientific software developer in the CodeAnno / WebAnno project.

## Research Interests
    - Cross-Modal Information Retrieval and Representation Learning
    - Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) for low-resource languages and cultures
    - Developing scientific tools and apps that work with multimodal data, such as text, image, audio, and video data.
    - Machine Learning for the Digital Humanities (DH)

## Awards
    - GSCL 2021-2023 Thesis Award for the best master's thesis. [(News Article)](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home/news/2023-gscl-thesis-award.html)
