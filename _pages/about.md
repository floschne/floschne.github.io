Hi, I'm Florian üëãüèº

I'm a passionate computer scientist whose IT journey began back in 2005 when I first got in touch with archaic MS-DOS.
16 years later, in the summer of 2021, I graduated as M.Sc. at the University of Hamburg.
Since October 2021 I started working as a research assistant at the [Language Technology (LT)](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home.html) group under the supervision of [Chris Biemann](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html).

I started officially as a PhD Student in April 2024 and expect my graduation in summer 2025.

Alongside my academic work, I completed two PhD research internships in industry:

- From May 2022 to August 2022, I was a research intern at IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, NY, USA under the supervision of [Alfio Gliozzo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B4Fp6qoAAAAJ&hl=en). The work resulted in a first author publication at K-CAP'23 on Ontology Alignment.
- From November 2023 to March 2023, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research in Bangalore, India  under the supervision of [Sunayana Sitaram](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PUxwYrkAAAAJ&hl=en). The work resulted in a first author publication at EMNLP'24 on benchmarking VLMs for low-resource languages.

Recently, I started collaborating with [Anne Lauscher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IbJS3UEAAAAJ&hl=en) and her Data Science group at the University of Hamburg on projects related to cultural bias in multimodal models.

## Research Interests üßê

During my studies, I found keen interest and amazement in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and the intersection of both:
Multimodal Machine Learning, which is now my active research field.

More specifically, I am interested in:

- Cross-Modal Information Retrieval and Representation Learning using multimodal transformer encoder models
- Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for low-resource languages and underrepresented cultures
- Developing scientific tools and apps that work with multimodal data, such as text, image, audio, and video data.
- Applying Machine Learning in interdisciplinary projects, e.g., Digital Humanities (DH) or Computational Social Science, to enhance their research processes.

## Awards ‚ú®

### GSCL 2021-2023 Award for The Best Master's Thesis

Every two years, GSCL awards two prizes worth ‚Ç¨ 400 each for the best student undergraduate thesis and for the best master‚Äôs thesis in the field of language technology and computational linguistics.
